# Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Projects** collection!  
This folder contains hands-on projects focused on security automation, password protection, and cyber threat prevention.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of cybersecurity concepts using programming and analysis techniques.

## Project List

### 1. [Password Strength Checker](password-strength-checker)
A Python tool that analyzes the strength of passwords based on character variety, length, and pattern detection.  
It encourages better password practices to defend against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

### 2. [Phishing Link Detector](phishing-link-detector)
(A sample placeholder — you can add later.)  
Detects suspicious URLs using keyword patterns, domain checks, and regular expressions to identify possible phishing attempts.

### 3. [Keylogger Detector](keylogger-detector)
(Another future project idea.)  
Scans running system processes for potential keylogger behavior to protect user input privacy.
